# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## AI-Powered Salesforce Test Automation Platform
**Version**: 2.1
**Date**: July 10, 2025
**Author**: Gemini

### 1. Introduction & Problem Statement
Manually translating business processes from documentation into automated test scripts for Salesforce is a slow, labor-intensive, and error-prone process. This bottleneck delays release cycles and complicates synchronization with evolving business processes. The AI-Powered Salesforce Test Automation Platform addresses this by using an AI co-pilot to analyze process documentation (.docx, .pdf) and generate robust, data-driven test scripts via a user-friendly web interface. The platform aims to streamline test creation, improve accuracy, and integrate seamlessly with Salesforce environments.

### 2. Goals & Objectives
**Primary Goal**: Reduce the time and effort required to create and manage Robot Framework test cases for Salesforce by 50% compared to manual processes.

**Objectives**:
- **Objective 1**: Automate analysis of process documents (.docx, .pdf, .txt, .md) to extract testable steps into a structured JSON format, achieving 90% accuracy in step identification.
- **Objective 2**: Generate high-quality, maintainable Robot Framework test script scaffolds using an approved keyword library, with 80% of steps auto-mapped to existing keywords.
- **Objective 3**: Provide an intuitive, accessible web interface for document upload, test draft review, and test execution monitoring, compliant with WCAG 2.1 standards.
- **Objective 4**: Generate standardized Process Definition Documents (PDDs) in Salesforce Unified Process Notation (UPN) format from structured JSON input.
- **Objective 5**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to enable automated test execution within DevOps workflows.

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce test script creation time by 50% (e.g., from 4 hours to 2 hours per script).
- Achieve 90% user adoption rate among automation engineers and QA testers within 6 months.
- Reduce test script errors by 30% compared to manual creation.
- Ensure 95% uptime for the web interface and test execution engine.

### 3. User Personas
- **Alex, the Automation Engineer**: Proficient in Robot Framework, Alex uses the platform to generate baseline scripts from documentation, finalizes scripts, implements new keywords, and monitors test suite health via the dashboard.
- **Brenda, the Business Analyst/QA Tester**: Knowledgeable in business processes, Brenda uploads procedure documents, reviews AI-generated steps for accuracy, and monitors test results related to her processes.
- **Charlie, the DevOps Engineer**: Manages CI/CD pipelines and integrates the platform with tools like Jenkins to automate test execution, ensuring seamless deployment workflows.

### 4. Features & Requirements
#### 4.1. Core Test Execution Framework
- **FR-1.1 (Robot Framework Engine)**: Use Robot Framework as the core test execution engine, supporting Salesforce Classic and Lightning environments.
- **FR-1.2 (Page Object Model)**: Implement a Page Object Model (POM) with abstracted keywords and locators in resource files for maintainability.
- **FR-1.3 (Data-Driven Capability)**: Support data-driven testing with external data sources (e.g., Excel, CSV, JSON).
- **FR-1.4 (External Configuration)**: Manage environment details (e.g., URLs, credentials) in external configuration files, supporting multiple Salesforce instances.
- **FR-1.5 (Self-Healing Tests)**: Incorporate self-healing capabilities to adapt to minor UI changes in Salesforce, reducing maintenance efforts.

#### 4.2. AI-Powered Test Generation Engine
- **FR-2.1 (Document Ingestion)**: Ingest and parse text from .docx, .pdf, .txt, and .md formats, supporting multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish).
- **FR-2.2 (AI Process Analysis)**: Use a fine-tuned LLM (e.g., BERT-based model) to analyze documents and generate structured JSON outputs describing sequential user actions. The model will be trained on Salesforce process documentation and updated quarterly with user feedback.
- **FR-2.3 (Keyword Mapping & Library)**: Scan .robot resource files to build an approved keyword library, mapping 80% of actions to existing keywords. Flag unmapped steps for human review and store feedback to improve model accuracy.
- **FR-2.4 (Test Case Scaffolding)**: Generate fully-formatted .robot files as draft test cases, ready for review and finalization.
- **FR-2.5 (Feedback Loop)**: Allow users to correct AI-generated steps via the web interface, feeding corrections back to the LLM for continuous learning.

#### 4.3. Process Definition Document (PDD) Generation
- **FR-3.1 (PDD Creation)**: Generate standardized PDDs in Markdown format using Salesforce UPN, linked to Salesforce metadata (e.g., objects, fields).
- **FR-3.2 (PDD Template)**: Structure PDDs as follows:
  - **Process Name**: [Name of the Process]
  - **Process ID**: [Unique Identifier]
  - **Pre-conditions**: List of states/conditions before the process.
  - **Process Steps**: Numbered list of user actions in UPN format (8-10 steps per diagram).
  - **Post-conditions**: List of states/conditions after successful completion.
  - **Metadata Links**: References to Salesforce metadata (e.g., Description fields).
- **FR-3.3 (Metadata Integration)**: Update Salesforce metadata Description fields with process details, ensuring AI readability per MDD principles.

#### 4.4. Web Interface & Test Execution
- **FR-4.1 (Document Upload)**: Provide a secure upload mechanism for .docx, .pdf, .txt, and .md files, with encryption (AES-256) for data at rest and in transit.
- **FR-4.2 (Draft Review)**: Display generated .robot test scaffolds in a readable format, allowing users to edit and approve drafts.
- **FR-4.3 (Test Execution Trigger)**: Enable authorized users to trigger test runs for specific suites, integrated with CI/CD pipelines.
- **FR-4.4 (Test Status Dashboard)**: Feature a dashboard displaying:
  - Test suite name
  - Last run timestamp
  - Overall status (PASS/FAIL)
  - Link to detailed Robot Framework log/report
  - Trend analysis (e.g., pass/fail trends over time)
  - Test coverage metrics
- **FR-4.5 (Accessibility)**: Ensure the web interface complies with WCAG 2.1 standards for accessibility.
- **FR-4.6 (Version Control Integration)**: Integrate with Git for version control of generated .robot files and PDDs.

#### 4.5. Scalability and Security
- **FR-5.1 (Scalability)**: Deploy on a cloud-based architecture (e.g., AWS, Azure) to handle up to 1,000 concurrent users and 10,000 document uploads daily.
- **FR-5.2 (Security)**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and compliance with GDPR and HIPAA.
- **FR-5.3 (Performance)**: Ensure test execution and document processing complete within 5 seconds for 95% of requests under normal load.

#### 4.6. User Training and Support
- **FR-6.1 (Training)**: Provide onboarding tutorials, video guides, and documentation for Alex, Brenda, and Charlie.
- **FR-6.2 (Support)**: Offer a help desk and community forum for user support, with 24/7 availability for enterprise clients.

### 5. Out of Scope (For Version 2.1)
- Fully autonomous test creation and execution without human review.
- AI-powered element locator generation.
- Automated test data generation.
- Complex user role and permission management beyond RBAC.

### 6. Risks and Mitigations
